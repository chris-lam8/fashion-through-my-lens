          <p>Welcome to Fashion Through My Lens! <br> The idea for this website is to inspire and educate people about streetwear and what is currently in trend. I want to use this medium as a way to communicate what I love about fashion. Being able to express yourself to others and yourself. The purpose of this website is to help those who are into high end streetwear and those who are looking to get into it, and where they can purchase these products from. I also want to allow for people who have other clothes, shoes or accessories to be able to trade with me. The intent of trading on this website isn't to sell or make profit. I promote trading items that are equal in price, so that you don't spend more money than me or users should have to.</p>
